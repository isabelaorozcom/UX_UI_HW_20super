      <h1>Understanding The User</h1>
      <p>
        Through a study we looked to understand how people who had stomach
        issues informed decisions on eating habits and identify what problems
        they had and what tools, solutions they used to make those issues
        better.
      </p>

      <h2>Research Primary Questions:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>What stomach issues they had?</li>
        <li>Have they been diagnosed or treated for those issues? </li>
        <li>How had technology helped them improve those problems? </li>
        <li>What they liked/disliked about those tools?</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Understanding the Problem</h1>
      <p>
        Using an affinity diagram we were able to identify the main pain points,
        remedies and restrictions our users had when looking to improve stomach
        related issues. Amongst those the most recurrent ones were the
        following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The main symptoms of discomfort was bloating </li>
        <li>Users have tried multiple remedies </li>
        <li>
          Users have difficult relationships with food because they felt
          everything impacted their stomach 
        </li>
        <li>
          Users would default to remove some foods from diet but sometimes that
          didn’t work either.
        </li>
        <li>
          Users were interested in mobile apps that could help them improve
          their condition
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h1>Analyzing existing solutions</h1>
      <p>
        We ran a competitive analysis to identify key threats and opportunity
        areas for the solution we wanted to offer.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div>
      <h1>Product vision and solution</h1>
      <h2>Enable users to accomplish 3 main tasks:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Track their symptoms</li>
        <li>Track what they ate</li>
        <li>Track how they felt</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The app would run correlations and identify trends with time in order to
        create a list of foods for the user to avoid or watch-out for in the
        future. The process to add foods, symptoms and mood had to be easy and
        quick to prevent burnout and loose adoption of the app. Additional
        features for subsequent iterations would be adding a list of home
        remedies based on the data input.
